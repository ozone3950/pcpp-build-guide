# PCPartPicker Build Guide

## Info

This guide will show you the optimal part choices for multiple different budgets. The lists are based in the UK, and will be updated monthly, so please follow this repository to be updated then.

There will be different budgets each month, but I will try and keep them around the same. Obviously some parts will be better value bought used, but these lists will only have new parts. Parts are obviously interchangable with other good value parts to suit the users needs, but these lists will just be some good guidelines.

This month will be a bit early since I just want to make the first few lists.

## [Entry Level Build - £700](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/PkXpH2)

- **CPU:** Intel Core i3-12100F `£92.64`
- **Cooler:** Intel Boxed Cooler `Free`
- **Motherboard:** Gigabyte B660M DS3H AX `£103.49`

- **PSU:** Corsair TX750M 2021 `£63.99`

Total Cost: `£704.81`

This build suits most people fine in 1080p 144hz gaming. The CPU will last a while in gaming and other single threaded tasks, the motherboard is good value and comes with WiFi, the memory is at pretty decent speed and can be overclocked fairly well, due to it having the Micron Rev. E IC. The SSD is cheap, fast, and has enough capacity for a good amount of games. The graphics card is very good value and will be able to play a lot of games at 1080p 144 FPS. The case is cheap, has sufficient airflow, has fans, and looks pretty nice. And lastly, the power supply is good value, and good enough to last quite a few upgrades.


## [Midrange Build -  £1050](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/ZqHLsL)

- **CPU:** Intel Core i5-12400F `£162.99`
- **Cooler:** Arctic Freezer 34 CO `£29.93`
- **Motherboard:** Gigabyte B660M DS3H AX `£103.49`
- **Memory:** Crucial Ballistix 16GB (2x8GB) 3200MHz CL16 `£56.61`

- **Case:** MSI MAG FORGE 100R ATX `£42.99`
- **PSU:** Corsair TX750M 2021 `£63.99`

Total Cost: `£1052.97`

Quite a few things in this build is the same or very similar to the previous ones, such as the motherboard, memory, SSD (apart from the capacity being higher), and power supply. This is because the parts are very good value and don't need to be changed, making the budget more focused on other upgrades. The CPU is very good for gaming, and even some productivity tasks, and the graphics card is fine for gaming at 1440p 144 FPS with ease, and finally, the case is just a bit better than the previous one.


## [High End Build -£1600](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/Ps6jZw)

Total: `£1628.47`

This build is for intensive gaming titles, and will also excel productivity, due to the 12700F with 8 performance and 4 efficiency cores, and 32GB of memory. The cooler will cooler will cool the CPU perfectly fine, with the 6800XT acing intensive titles at over 1440p 144 FPS. The case is also a bit nicer than the previous one, same with the power supply.

- **PSU:** Bitfenix Whisper M 850W `£115.50`

Total: `£2195.50`

This build is extremely high end and for people who are hardware enthusiasts and OC as a hobby aswell. The 12700K is very good value for a high-end CPU and has quite a large headroom for overclocking, aswell as being able to overclock memory well. The Eisbaer is a very good AIO, and can even be expanded into a custom loop, though if you are going for an enthusiast level build like this one, I do recommend making a custom water loop from the start, and you can get info about that from my custom watercooling repository. The motherboard has very sufficient VRMs for overclocking the CPU, and is also one of the best Z690 boards for DDR4 memory overclocking. The memory in this list will need to be found used on a platform such as eBay, since the used price is always significantly better in this case. The S70 Blade is a very fast SSD for any workload and not at too bad of a price. The GPU is a special version of the 6900XT, since it has a die that clocks better than the reference one, they can be found [here](https://www.overclock.net/threads/a-list-of-different-types-of-6900-xtxh-gpus.1794330/). The P500A is a big case with amazing airflow and radiator support. And lastly, the Whisper M is a very good quality power supply with a large wattage in order to be sufficient for overclocking this high end hardware.
